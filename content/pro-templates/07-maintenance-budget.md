## Appendix: Excel/Spreadsheet Setup Tips

### Formulas for Budget Tracking

```
Variance = Budget - Actual
Variance % = (Budget - Actual) / Budget * 100
YTD Total = SUM(Jan:Current Month)
Forecast = YTD Actual + (Monthly Avg * Remaining Months)
Cost % of RAV = Annual Maint Cost / Replacement Asset Value * 100
Cost per Unit = Annual Maint Cost / Annual Production Units
```

### Conditional Formatting Rules

| Condition | Color | Use For |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Variance ≥ 10% | Green | Favorable budget items |
| Variance -5% to 10% | Yellow | Watch items |
| Variance < -10% | Red | Over budget items |
| Status = Complete | Green | Project tracking |
| Status = At Risk | Red | Project tracking |
