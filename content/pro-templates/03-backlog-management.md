|---------|-----------------|
| WO age exceeds SLA by 2x | Mandatory review |
| Equipment condition changed | Re-evaluate impact |
| Production schedule changed | Check business impact |
| Safety incident on similar asset | Escalate if related |
| Parts now available | Move to ready backlog |
| Resource constraints | May need to escalate or defer |

### Priority Decision Matrix

Use this matrix to validate or adjust work order priority:

| Factor | P1-P2 (High) | P3-P4 (Medium) | P5-P6 (Low) |
|--------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Safety Impact** | Immediate risk to personnel | Potential risk if not addressed | No safety impact |
| **Production Impact** | Line/plant down or imminent | Reduced capacity/efficiency | Minimal or no impact |
| **Environmental** | Active leak/emission | Potential compliance issue | No environmental impact |
| **Asset Condition** | Failed or failing | Degraded performance | Normal wear |
| **Redundancy** | No backup available | Partial redundancy | Full backup in place |
| **Cost of Delay** | >$10K/day | $1K-$10K/day | <$1K/day |

### Priority Change Authorization

| Change Type | Authorized By |
|-------------|---------------|
| Upgrade to P1/P2 | Supervisor + Ops Manager |
| P3 → P4 or P4 → P3 | Planner |
| Downgrade to P5/P6 | Planner + Requestor approval |
| Close without work | Supervisor |

### Re-assessment Checklist

- [ ] Is the original problem still valid?
- [ ] Has equipment condition changed?
- [ ] Are there related WOs that should be combined?
- [ ] Is the estimated labor still accurate?
- [ ] Are all parts/materials identified and available?
- [ ] Is contractor support still needed?
- [ ] Does Operations still agree with priority?
- [ ] Should this be converted to a PM task?

## 6. Work Order Screening Checklist

*Use this checklist when new work requests are submitted to determine if a formal work order is needed.*

### Initial Screening Questions

| # | Question | Yes | No | Action if No |
|---|----------|-----|----|--------------|
| 1 | Is this a legitimate maintenance need? | ☐ | ☐ | Reject - explain why |
| 2 | Is the equipment/asset identified? | ☐ | ☐ | Return for more info |
| 3 | Does this require skilled labor (>15 min)? | ☐ | ☐ | Handle as operator task |
| 4 | Is this different from existing WOs? | ☐ | ☐ | Add to existing WO |
| 5 | Is this a maintenance responsibility? | ☐ | ☐ | Redirect to correct dept |
| 6 | Is the problem clearly described? | ☐ | ☐ | Return for clarification |

### Should This Be a Work Order?

| Scenario | Create WO? | Alternative |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Quick fix <15 minutes | ❌ | Operator task or standing WO |
| Adjustment/calibration | ⚠️ Maybe | Could be operator or PM task |
| Repeated same issue | ✅ Yes | But investigate root cause |
| Cosmetic only, no function impact | ❌ | Low priority list or defer |
| "While you're there..." add-on | ❌ | Add to existing WO scope |
| Improvement/modification | ⚠️ Maybe | May need project/MOC process |
| PM task discovered issue | ✅ Yes | Link to parent PM |
| Emergency/breakdown | ✅ Yes | Expedite process |
| Duplicate of open WO | ❌ | Reference existing WO# |
| Equipment scheduled for replacement | ❌ | Document for project |

### WO Quality Checklist

*Before approving a new WO, verify:*

- [ ] **Asset ID** - Correct equipment number/tag
- [ ] **Location** - Building/area/line specified
- [ ] **Problem description** - Clear, specific symptoms
- [ ] **Priority** - Appropriate based on impact
- [ ] **Requestor** - Valid contact for follow-up
- [ ] **Safety concerns** - Hazards identified
- [ ] **Photos/attachments** - Included if helpful
- [ ] **Access requirements** - Permits, lockout, scaffolding noted

### Screening Decision Tree

```
Is it a real maintenance issue?
├── NO → Reject with explanation
└── YES → Does a similar WO already exist?
    ├── YES → Add to existing WO
    └── NO → Does it require >15 min skilled labor?
        ├── NO → Operator task or standing WO
        └── YES → Is equipment correctly identified?
            ├── NO → Return for information
            └── YES → CREATE WORK ORDER ✓
```

**Calculation Example:**
```
Ready Backlog Hours: 800 hours
Weekly Capacity: 200 hours (5 techs × 40 hrs)
Backlog Weeks = 800 ÷ 200 = 4.0 weeks ✓
```

**Interpretation:**
| Value | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| <2 weeks | 🟡 Under-backlog | May indicate poor capture or idle capacity |
| 2-4 weeks | 🟢 Healthy | Optimal range - maintain |
| 4-6 weeks | 🟡 Elevated | Review priorities, consider OT |
| >6 weeks | 🔴 Critical | Backlog reduction plan required |

#### 7.2 Ready Backlog Percentage

**Categories:**
- **Ready**: All parts, materials, permits, and information available
- **Waiting**: Missing parts, info, permits, or access

**Interpretation:**
| Value | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| >80% | 🟢 Excellent | Schedule with confidence |
| 60-80% | 🟡 Acceptable | Focus on clearing blockers |
| <60% | 🔴 Poor | Parts/planning process issues |

#### 7.3 Backlog Aging Percentage

## 8. Best Practices for Healthy Backlog

### The 2-4 Weeks Rule

A healthy maintenance backlog represents **2-4 weeks** of ready work. This provides:

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Flexibility** | Enough work to fill schedule gaps |
| **Efficiency** | Time to plan, kit, and optimize |
| **Responsiveness** | Not so much that urgent work gets lost |
| **Visibility** | Manageable size to review regularly |

### Backlog Health Indicators

| Healthy Backlog | Unhealthy Backlog |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| 2-4 weeks of ready work | >6 weeks or <1 week |
| >80% ready to schedule | <60% ready |
| <20% older than 30 days | >40% older than 30 days |
| Clear priority distribution | Everything is "high priority" |
| Regular weekly reviews | No regular review process |
| Declining or stable trend | Growing every week |
| Mix of trades balanced | One trade severely overloaded |

### Best Practices Checklist

#### Daily
- [ ] Review new work requests within 24 hours
- [ ] Update WO statuses as work progresses
- [ ] Flag emergency/urgent work immediately

#### Weekly
- [ ] Conduct backlog review meeting
- [ ] Review all WOs >30 days old
- [ ] Update parts status on waiting WOs
- [ ] Close completed work promptly
- [ ] Generate and review KPI metrics

#### Monthly
- [ ] Deep-dive aging WOs >60 days
- [ ] Review backlog by trade for balance
- [ ] Analyze input vs output trends
- [ ] Adjust capacity planning if needed
- [ ] Report KPIs to management

#### Quarterly
- [ ] Full backlog cleanup exercise
- [ ] Review screening criteria effectiveness
- [ ] Assess priority accuracy
- [ ] Benchmark against targets
- [ ] Update procedures as needed

### Maintaining Balance

```
                    BACKLOG BALANCE
                    
    Too Low (<2 wks)         Too High (>6 wks)
    ─────────────────────────────────────────
    • Idle technicians       • Work gets lost
    • Reactive mode          • Priorities unclear
    • Poor planning time     • Deferred forever
    • May miss work          • Frustration grows
    
              SWEET SPOT: 2-4 WEEKS
              ─────────────────────
              • Optimal efficiency
              • Good planning time
              • Clear priorities
              • Manageable reviews

## 9. Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | Symptoms | Root Cause | Solution |
|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| **Backlog keeps growing** | WO count increases weekly, backlog weeks >6 | Input exceeds output; insufficient resources or poor screening | Implement stricter screening; add resources; schedule OT blitz; contractor support |
| **Too many "high priority" WOs** | >50% marked P1-P2; everything is urgent | No priority discipline; fear of work not getting done | Re-establish priority criteria; require justification for P1-P2; operations sign-off |
| **Ancient WOs (>90 days)** | Significant % of backlog over 90 days old | No regular review; fear of closing WOs; parts issues | Mandatory monthly cleanup; supervisor authority to close; escalate chronic blockers |
| **Low ready backlog %** | <60% ready to schedule; lots of waiting WOs | Poor parts identification; procurement delays; incomplete planning | Improve job plans; dedicated parts expeditor; planner training; better CMMS use |
| **Duplicate work orders** | Same issue submitted multiple times | No duplicate check; poor CMMS search; lack of feedback to requestors | Screening process; train requestors; CMMS duplicate detection; communicate WO status |
| **Work completed but WOs open** | Technicians don't close WOs; backlog inflated | No accountability; cumbersome close-out; no time allocated | Simplify close-out; mandate same-day closure; supervisor follow-up; mobile CMMS |
| **Imbalanced by trade** | One trade at 8 weeks, another at 1 week | Skill mix mismatch; training gaps; cross-training lacking | Cross-train technicians; contractor support for bottleneck trade; adjust hiring |
| **Reactive work dominates** | >40% emergency/urgent; can't get to planned work | Poor PM program; aging equipment; deferred maintenance | Improve PM effectiveness; address bad actors; make time for planned work |
| **WOs lack information** | Can't schedule due to missing details | Poor work request process; no standards; requestor training gap | Implement request standards; require fields in CMMS; planner follow-up process |
| **No one owns backlog management** | Metrics not tracked; no review meetings; chaos | Unclear roles; competing priorities; no accountability | Assign planner ownership; scheduled reviews; management support; KPI targets |
